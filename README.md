# Aura — Pave the Road 🚀

**Pave the Road**  
*From Thought to Finish*

Aura is an AI-powered planning application that transforms raw ideas into structured, execution-ready blueprints. It helps builders, especially in **hackathons and rapid development environments**, move from an initial thought to a clear implementation plan with confidence.

Users describe what they want to build in plain language, and Aura generates a step-by-step roadmap including recommended programming languages, frameworks, tools, and overall system structure.
